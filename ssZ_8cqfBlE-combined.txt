they're

the

away
00:02:25.520

how

you
00:04:24.240
think

but
00:04:25.360
most
00:04:25.520
people
00:04:25.759
wouldn't
00:04:25.919
consider

their
00:04:26.560
gut
00:04:26.800
bacteria
00:04:27.280

act

roughly
00:04:32.639
our
00:04:32.800
scale
00:04:33.280
it's
00:04:33.520
easy
00:04:33.680
to
00:04:33.759
look
00:04:33.919
at
00:04:34.000
the

hive
00:04:34.560
see
00:04:34.800
the
00:04:34.880
moving
00:04:35.199
boxes
00:04:35.520
and
00:04:35.600
go
00:04:35.840
okay
00:04:36.479
2
00:04:36.800
000
00:04:37.040
robots

only
00:04:38.800
one
00:04:39.040
00:04:39.759
and
00:04:39.840
the
00:04:40.000
box
00:04:40.240
is
00:04:40.320
just
00:04:40.560
following

the

paths
00:04:41.199
they're
00:04:41.360
given
00:04:41.919
i'd
00:04:42.160
say
00:04:42.320
there's
00:04:42.479
a
00:04:42.560
good
00:04:42.720
argument
00:04:43.120
that
00:04:43.280
that
00:04:43.600
is
00:04:44.000
one
00:04:44.320
robot
00:04:45.280
with
00:04:45.600
2
00:04:45.919
