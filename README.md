# YTClipsBySubs
Uses YouTube auto subtitles to clip words/phrases from a video(s)

This is still not quite working. For anyone interested, I put what I have so far. See [issue #1](https://github.com/cjcarrick/YTClipsBySubs/issues/1#issue-939416802) for details.

TODO:

- [ ] fix [#1](https://github.com/cjcarrick/YTClipsBySubs/issues/1#issue-939416802)
- [ ] Add option to "buffer" matches by a little bit (Eg: Add .1 second before and after each match)
- [ ] Add support for multi-word searches
- [ ] More informative/better laid out verbosity
